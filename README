This script is an automation script, requires a few pieces of software:

Transmission bittorrent downloader
Filebot Java File Renamer
Flexget (optional)

This script will wait for a download to finish in transmission, if it was added by flexget then it will remove it from transmission, unrar/extract it and cleanup folders, then call filebot to rename the files
